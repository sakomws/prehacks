# ðŸš€ JobHax Chrome Extension - Installation Guide

## Overview
The JobHax Chrome Extension now includes an **Auto Apply** button that captures the current job application URL and starts the autonomous agent to fill out the form automatically.

## Features
- **ðŸš€ Auto Apply Button**: Captures current URL and starts the autonomous agent
- **ðŸ“Š Real-time Monitoring**: Connects to monitoring dashboard for live progress updates
- **ðŸ”„ WebSocket Integration**: Sends progress updates to the monitoring UI
- **ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Tracking**: Monitors agent activity with real-time screenshots

## Installation Steps

### 1. Load the Extension in Chrome
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `chrome_extension` folder: `/Users/sakom/github/prehacks/apps/recruitment/chrome_extension/`
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### 2. Start Required Services
Make sure these services are running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the autonomous agent server
cd /Users/sakom/github/prehacks/apps/recruitment/jhv5
source .venv/bin/activate
python real_main.py

# Terminal 2: Start the WebSocket server
cd /Users/sakom/github/prehacks/apps/recruitment/jhv5/monitor-ui
node websocket-server.js

# Terminal 3: Start the monitoring UI
cd /Users/sakom/github/prehacks/apps/recruitment/jhv5/monitor-ui
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Extension
1. Open the test page: `file:///Users/sakom/github/prehacks/apps/recruitment/chrome_extension/test_extension.html`
2. Click the JobHax extension icon in your browser toolbar
3. Click the "ðŸš€ Auto Apply" button
4. Watch the monitoring dashboard open at `http://localhost:3001`

## How It Works

### Auto Apply Flow
1. **Capture URL**: Extension gets the current tab's URL
2. **Start Agent**: Sends POST request to `http://localhost:8080/apply` with the job URL
3. **Monitor Progress**: Connects to WebSocket server for real-time updates
4. **Open Dashboard**: Automatically opens monitoring UI at `http://localhost:3001`

### Monitoring Integration
- **WebSocket Connection**: Connects to `ws://localhost:8081`
- **Progress Updates**: Sends real-time status updates to monitoring dashboard
- **Screenshot Tracking**: Monitors agent screenshots and form filling progress
