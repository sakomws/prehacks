## How It Works

### Smart Field Detection

The extension uses multiple strategies to find form fields:

1. **Attribute Matching**: Looks for `name`, `id`, `placeholder`, `aria-label`, `data-testid`
2. **Type Detection**: Identifies `email`, `tel`, `text`, `file` input types
3. **Content Analysis**: Analyzes field labels and context
4. **Platform-Specific**: Uses selectors optimized for each job platform

### Form Filling Process

1. **Page Analysis**: Scans the page for job application forms
2. **Field Mapping**: Maps detected fields to resume data
3. **Smart Filling**: Fills fields using appropriate methods (input, select, textarea)
4. **Event Triggering**: Triggers necessary events for form validation
5. **Verification**: Checks that fields were filled correctly

### Submit Button Detection

The extension intelligently finds submit buttons while avoiding:
- Cookie consent buttons
- Privacy policy buttons
- Settings buttons
- Navigation buttons

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check Site Support**
   - Ensure you're on a supported job site
   - Look for the JobHax notification on the page

2. **Refresh the Page**
   - Sometimes a page refresh helps
   - Try disabling and re-enabling the extension

3. **Check Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for JobHax logs in the console

### Fields Not Filling

1. **Manual Field Detection**
   - Some forms use non-standard field names
   - Try filling manually and note the field names

2. **Report Issues**
   - Submit an issue with the job site URL
   - Include screenshots of the form

### Submit Button Issues

1. **Manual Submission**
   - If auto-submit fails, click submit manually
   - The extension will still fill the form

2. **Multi-Step Forms**
   - Some forms have multiple steps
   - Use "Auto-Fill Current Page" for each step

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: The extension doesn't collect or transmit your data
- **Local Storage**: All resume data is stored locally in your browser
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or tracking of your job applications
- **Open Source**: Full source code is available for review
