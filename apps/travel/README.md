## Adding New Travel Applications

To add a new travel-related application:

1. **Create a new directory** in this `travel/` folder
2. **Follow the naming convention:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `my-travel-app`)
3. **Include essential files:**
   - `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
   - `package.json` or `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
   - `.env.example` - Environment variables template
   - `LICENSE` - License file
4. **Update this README** to include your new application
5. **Follow the project structure** established by existing apps

### Recommended Structure
```
travel/
â”œâ”€â”€ my-new-app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Comprehensive documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # or requirements.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example          # Environment variables
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE               # License file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code

## Guidelines

### Travel-Specific Considerations
- **Real-time Data**: Consider using live APIs for current information
- **Booking Integration**: Include direct links to booking platforms
- **Location Services**: Implement proper location handling
- **Multi-language Support**: Consider international users
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure mobile-friendly interfaces

### Documentation
- Document API integrations and data sources
- Include setup instructions for external services
- Provide examples of search queries and responses
- Document any rate limits or usage restrictions

### Performance
- Optimize for real-time data fetching
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider API rate limits
- Monitor response times and error rates
